Using her code as a basis for my Unity project, I had to change the character handeling to add a prefarb model different from hers character. 

In her declaration of external functions, she wrote : 

```
        EXTERNAL ShowCharacter(characterName, position, mood)
        EXTERNAL HideCharacter(characterName)       
```
